                	<h1 class="page-title">Job Description</h1>
                	<p>The second level support team responds to incident tickets escalated by the first level service desk for Co-operators employees that have called in about a problem. These tickets describe enterprise software and hardware problems that may require mid-level troubleshooting on a single machine to significant events that affect company operations on a large scale. My roles as a Technical Support Analyst include using investigative techniques to resolve incidents quickly, finding patterns to resolve problems proactively, and creating detailed procedural documentation. I was able to closely observe human-computer interaction and complex issues often encountered with large scale computer systems and enterprise software.</p>
									<p>Our team uses an online ticketing dashboard which acts as our first point of contact with callers. A Technical Support Analyst analyzes the incident and performs the necessary troubleshooting steps required to solve the problem. Often, the problems described come from a known issue which may have an existing knowledge article. These outline the resolution procedures for the team which the ticket is currently assigned to and are attached once the issue is determined. Knowledge articles must be detailed and kept up to date with the current technical platform of the company. Should an issue of some significance with no knowledge article arise a Technical Support Analyst must work to resolve the issue and create a knowledge article documenting the relevant steps that they followed. This is the most interesting and demanding part of the job as you work closely with the caller to discover new ways to solve a technical problem.</p>
									<p>I was required to communicate technical details concisely and professionally to those I was assisting from corporate executives to insurance advisors in the field. I had to use critical thinking to resolve issues with enterprise technology I was sometimes not familiar with. Explaining my thought process in terms the user would understand allowed me to build a better rapport and gain insight into the problem much faster. I became strongly proficient in considering the problem from the eyes of the end user and quickly assessing different solutions to try. However, I first learned this skill from my classes in Software Design I-III when considering how to apply human-computer interaction techniques to the design of graphical user interfaces.</p>
									<p>From working closely with technology to working closely with end users I gained a better understanding of the complexity of the enterprise techical platform and a proficiency for problem-solving by the end of my work term at The Co-operators. </p>
