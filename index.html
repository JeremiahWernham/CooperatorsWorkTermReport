            <h2 class="page-title">Introduction</h2>
            <p>At the Co-operators, the second-level support team responds to incident tickets escalated by the first level service desk for Co-operators employees that have called in about a problem. These tickets include enterprise software and hardware problems that range from mid-level troubleshooting on a single machine to significant events that affect company operations on a large scale. My roles as a Technical Support Analyst include using investigative techniques to resolve incidents quickly, finding patterns to resolve problems proactively, and creating detailed procedural documentation. I was able to closely observe human-computer interaction and complex issues often encountered with large scale computer systems and enterprise software. By the end of this report you, the reader, may begin to understand why this four-month work term allowed me to mold the belief that every software developer should first work from a support perspective. Being able to see from the eyes of the end user will result in more user-friendly, innovative software solutions.</p>
						<h2>Information About The Employer</h2>
						<p>The Co-operators Group Ltd., founded in 1945, is a Canadian insurance co-operative based in Guelph, Ontario. As a co-operative it owes several operating companies, the largest of which is Co-operators General Insurance Company (CGIC). It is one of the leading Canadian-owned multi-line insurers, and offers auto, home, life, farm, travel and business insurance as well as investments through its network of more than 485 exclusive agents. Other member companies are HB Group Insurance of Mississauga, The Sovereign General Insurance Company of Calgary, CUMIS Group Limited based in Burlington, Ontario, and investment firm Addenda Capital of Montreal.</p>
						<p>Information Technology (IT) is interwoven in all levels of the company. With each one of around 4,850 employees that use computer technology in their daily workflow, it is imperative that IT supports individuals from large corporate offices to the small agencies across Canada. It is on the shoulders of IT teams to test, deploy, and maintain enterprise software and hardware, fix all matters of technical issues in a timely manner, and even automate existing levels of production, some being on legacy systems.</p>
						<p>My own team acts as the second level of defense in handling incident tickets that require more in-depth troubleshooting using generalized knowledge of all company software and hardware, or attention from third level teams specialized for a specific application.</p>
