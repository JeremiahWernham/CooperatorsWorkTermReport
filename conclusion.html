                	<p>In conclusion, my role as a Technical Support Analyst at The Co-operators was beneficial to my career goal of working in a software development role because I gained a deeper understanding of human-computer interaction and a wider view of how software must be developed and maintained to run on an enterprise network. I believe that in the future the individuals using software solutions that I am a part of will prosper because I will always work with the end user in mind. I was hands-on in discovering caveats in the end-to-end development of existing applications, and the changes that I would make to benefit the individual end users and company as a whole.</p>
