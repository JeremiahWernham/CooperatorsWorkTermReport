                		<li>
                			<h2>CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry & Analysis </h2>
											<p>Create new cmdlets and small GUI-based applications to help automated the day-to-day processes of the team.</p>
											<h3>Action Plan</h3>
                			<p>Inquire about possible team processes that would benefit from small automation tools and analyzing the usefulness of tools I create to hopefully integrate them into everyday work. Before I can begin to develop these tools I need to improve my working knowledge of scripting languages such as Windows Powershell and Python. Taking online certificate courses while the ticket queue in relatively slow would be an effective way of doing this. Using my knowledge acquired in class about user-friendly software development and quickly learning about different libraries and frameworks can help increase the quality and robustness of my scripts. Having a co-worker test and provide feedback about the application would allow me to improve on it as well. This would also allow me to improve existing scripts and applications the team uses. </p>
											<h3>Measure of Success</h3>
											<p>Contribute to the efficiency of any existing process that the team uses somewhat regularly. I will attempt to create a tool that serves the general workflow or a more specialized application such as for tickets that require me to gather more information about a computer on the network. I can determine if the tool I create is useful by generating survey feedback through an online survey web application and even improve on the application with criticism of the team. Ultimately, I aim to be satisfied with the tool itself given the time and effort to learn and use a new scripting language.</p>
											<h3>Reflection</h3>
											<p>In my free time, while minimal, Lynda.com offered by the University of Guelph did allow me to learn about Windows PowerShell and Python as scripting languages and expand my knowledge of how existing GUI-based programs that use these languages on my teamwork. With this knowledge I wrote a short program for myself called "Start Up" which would automatically open and order the windows which I needed to start my workday. Thought not having a GUI, I used this program every morning. Secondly, I was able to create short PowerShell scripts that I would use when reporting on different workstations on the Co-operators network. For example, during deployments I would run a script that would return the current version of an application to tell me if they were up-to-date. Overall, I did not find need to create a complicated GUI-based program to improve my team's everyday work, however with what I learned about these languages I was able to create numerous small ones to save a lot of time and energy.</p>

                			<h2>PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Teamwork</h2>
											<p>Achieve strong incident response and resolution statistics compared to team members and receive positive survey feedback in monthly reviews.</p>
											<h3>Action Plan</h3>
                			<p>Statistics and supervisor feedback I receive monthly help me identify areas where I can continue to improve. The statistics included review the percentage of tickets resolved across the team for the month and percentage of incidents to which we've attached relevant and correct knowledge articles. For the month of May, I held the top spot for incidents resolved at 72 tickets (8.88% of the team). I plan to achieve strong statistics over four monthly reports and apply the guidance and constructive criticism of my coworkers/supervisor to improve my contribution to the team. I will also need to follow proper protocols in incident quality and service level agreements to work with users in a professional, helpful, and timely manner.</p>
											<h3>Measure of Success</h3>
											<p>First, maintain a consistent amount of tickets taken along each month, at least 6%, which is often above average across all team members. Secondly, I aim to attach the relevant knowledge articles to more than 85% of my resolved tickets, which is important in finding parts of knowledge that need updating and aids team members that look at past incidents for reference. Lastly, I aim to receive positive feedback from the people I assist each month and put into action any constructive feedback that I receive. Doing this consistently over the next 4 months would be considered a success.</p>
											<h3>Reflection</h3>
											<p>According to the feedback I received in monthly reviews, I achieved my goal of strong incident resolution statistics each month averaging around 7 percent of total tickets that month. Some of the highlights in survey feedback I received are:
											<blockquote>"Jeremiah was great! He was friendly, professional and courteous. I especially liked how he told me what he was going to do every step of the way so that I could follow along with his thought process. Also, it was much better than sitting there with dead air wondering if the agent was still there or not (which has happened in the past). He also let me know when he needed to take something away and work on it and was respectful of my time by asking when I was available for an interruption."</blockquote>
											<blockquote>"My call was escalated to Jeremiah, and he resolved the issue. He was great to deal with, his descriptive language was so helpful when walking me through what to do on my end. He was very helpful and pleasant."</blockquote>
											I was continually above average and above my goal of attaching relevant knowledge to incidents, averaging around 93% of tickets. This, included with the feedback I received, allows me to feel confident that I have accomplished this goal.

                			<h2>PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Leadership </h2>
											<p>Aid in project work in the company and display valuable qualities to later become a project lead.</p>
											<h3>Action Plan</h3>
                			<p>My role as a Technical Support Analyst is to respond to and resolve problem tickets escalated to our team but also to participate in project work. Projects that are ongoing include updating all workstation to a more secure version of Windows and reviewing knowledge articles submitted by external teams for publication. My action plan for achieving this goal is continuing to meet the individual needs of users in their transition from their current Windows version to the next. From the preparation stage to any incidents that are called in by users, I aim to assist in getting everyone in the company upgraded by the end of my work term. In assisting the project lead directly, along with my past experiences in project work, I can become a strong contender for the decision of future project leads. To achieve my goal of becoming a project lead I must display qualities of initiative, work ethic, communication, and time management in this current project.</p>
											<h3>Measure of Success</h3>
											<p>Because the project has just begun, our preliminary course of action is to query how many computers are currently running and older version of Windows and need the upgrade. Because the team aims to complete this upgrade within the next few months, my measure of success is to aid in and resolve any incidents that come my way with regards to the project. This also means the creation any of new problem records and knowledge articles once any solutions to project-related incidents arise. In displaying the professional qualities listed above my final measure of success is to be elected as lead of another project in the future.</p>
											<h3>Reflection</h3>
											<p>From my action plan to my measure of success for this work term goal, I achieved exactly what I set out to do. By taking the initiative of aiding individual users in updating I was hands-on in addressing any concerns they had and accommodating their busy work schedules. I also ensured that any complications that arose from these updates was dealt with swiftly. We were able to ensure all users had updated to the necessary software. As a result of my continued assistance in project work, I was appointed project lead of the design and migration of our computer replacement process from a database application to integrate in to an online system. Using my knowledge of the software development life cycle I was able to gather requirements from multiple teams that have stakes in this project allowing me to implement a stable workflow to replace out-of-date systems and procedures. This will greatly increase the efficiency of future replacements saving the company time and money as a result.</p>

                			<h2>COMMUNICATING - Written Communication</h2>
											<p>Write or Edit 5 useful and informative knowledge articles per month for users and technical analysts to find solutions for technical issues.</p>
											<h3>Action Plan</h3>
                			<p>Part of my role as a Technical Support Analysts includes documenting new known errors and how to articles with solutions for everyone across Co-operators IT teams to reference and attach to tickets. The articles should include screenshots of the relevant errors and step by step instructions on how to fix them. When a new problem that hasn't been diagnosed arises my objective is to first resolve the problem, sometimes with the discretion of other teammates, and research done on the internet. Next, I type detailed notes on my resolution process and use them to create useful and informative knowledge articles for such errors or inquiries in the future. This requires both a strong understanding of computers and computer software and an observant eye in recognizing the main problem component(s). I aim to have my knowledge articles peer-reviewed and published by my teammates with little or no critical remarks or changes to made.</p>
											<h3>Measure of Success</h3>
											<p>When a knowledge article is submitted for publication, it is first peer reviewed for proper spelling and grammar, relevance, and quality. My measure of success is to have 90% of my knowledge articles approved on the first submission. I am to author or edit 5 each month though another measure of success is to author several knowledge articles with a view count of more than 20 by the end of the work term. This would ensure that my contributions are readable and relevant for my team members.</p>
											<h3>Reflection</h3>
											<p>Throughout my term, I was consistent in updating existing knowledge in our database 5 or more times per month. As well, I became proficient in simplifying articles with steps that would resolve the issue more quickly while removing any unnecessary steps toward fixing the problem. I pioneered multiple different problem records for large scale issues that required new documentation to resolve and prevent future incidents. Each pear reviewed and approved with little editing required. Therefore, I was successful in achieving this goal.</p>
